# React Hooks
(Normal JS utility Functions)
- useState() - SuperPowerful State Variables in react
* useState() Hook is a function provided by react that return array with two elements.
* which we destructured into two variables -  current state value and state updater function.

1st variable named - current state value, The initial value of state is passed as an argument to useState() for eg. "name".

2nd variable, the state updater function e.g., setName(), is used to update the state. When you call this function with a new value, React schedules a re-render(not synchronously always) the component to reflect the updated state.
                              const [reactBtn, setReactBtn] = useState("login");
                              onClick={() => {
                                                reactBtn === "login"
                                                ? setReactBtn("logout")
                                                : setReactBtn("login"); 
                                              }
                                        }
